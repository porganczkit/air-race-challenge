# Air Race Challenge - Development Progress

## Step 1: Initialize Project Structure - COMPLETED

- Created project folders:
  - `/src` - Main source code
  - `/assets` - 3D models, textures, and audio
  - `/ui` - UI components
  - `/services` - External services like leaderboard
  - `/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/entities` - Game entities like aircraft and gates
  - `/core` - Core game functionality

- Initialized npm project with `npm init`
- Installed key dependencies:
  - three.js for 3D rendering
  - vite for development server and building
  - eslint for code linting
  - prettier for code formatting

- Created initial files:
  - index.html with canvas element
  - src/main.js with basic initialization
  - Placeholder files in each folder to establish structure
  - .gitignore file for excluding node_modules, etc.
  - README.md with setup instructions

- Test confirmed:
  - Project runs via `npm run dev`
  - Blank canvas displays with initialization message

## Step 2: Set Up Git and GitHub Repository - COMPLETED

- Initialized Git repository with `git init`
- Added all project files to Git
- Created initial commit with message "feat: Initialize project structure (Step 1)"
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/porganczkit/air-race-challenge.git
- Connected local repository to GitHub remote
- Pushed all code to GitHub

- Test confirmed:
  - GitHub repository contains all project files
  - Repository structure matches local project structure

## Step 3: Create Basic Three.js Scene - COMPLETED

- Imported Three.js library
- Created a scene with sky-blue background color
- Set up a perspective camera
- Configured WebGL renderer with the canvas element
- Added ambient and directional lighting
- Created a rotating green cube as a test object
- Implemented a render loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Added window resize handling for responsive rendering

- Test confirmed:
  - Rotating green cube appears on screen
  - Lighting creates proper shadows and reflections
  - Animation runs smoothly

## Step 4: Implement Game Loop - COMPLETED

- Created a GameEngine class in core/engine.js:
  - Proper initialization of Three.js components
  - Time-based animation using THREE.Clock
  - Delta time calculation for consistent movement regardless of frame rate
  - Object tracking for updates and rendering
  - Methods for adding and removing objects from the scene

- Refactored main.js to use the new GameEngine:
  - Removed direct Three.js code
  - Added FPS counter for performance monitoring
  - Cleaner separation of initialization and game loop

- Test confirmed:
  - Object moves continuously within the loop
  - FPS counter shows stable frame rate
  - Animation speed is consistent regardless of device performance
