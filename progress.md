# Air Race Challenge - Development Progress

## Step 1: Initialize Project Structure - COMPLETED

- Created project folders:
  - `/src` - Main source code
  - `/assets` - 3D models, textures, and audio
  - `/ui` - UI components
  - `/services` - External services like leaderboard
  - `/utils` - Utility functions
  - `/entities` - Game entities like aircraft and gates
  - `/core` - Core game functionality

- Initialized npm project with `npm init`
- Installed key dependencies:
  - three.js for 3D rendering
  - vite for development server and building
  - eslint for code linting
  - prettier for code formatting

- Created initial files:
  - index.html with canvas element
  - src/main.js with basic initialization
  - Placeholder files in each folder to establish structure
  - .gitignore file for excluding node_modules, etc.
  - README.md with setup instructions

- Test confirmed:
  - Project runs via `npm run dev`
  - Blank canvas displays with initialization message

## Step 2: Set Up Git and GitHub Repository - COMPLETED

- Initialized Git repository with `git init`
- Added all project files to Git
- Created initial commit with message "feat: Initialize project structure (Step 1)"
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/porganczkit/air-race-challenge.git
- Connected local repository to GitHub remote
- Pushed all code to GitHub

- Test confirmed:
  - GitHub repository contains all project files
  - Repository structure matches local project structure

## Step 3: Create Basic Three.js Scene - COMPLETED

- Imported Three.js library
- Created a scene with sky-blue background color
- Set up a perspective camera
- Configured WebGL renderer with the canvas element
- Added ambient and directional lighting
- Created a rotating green cube as a test object
- Implemented a render loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Added window resize handling for responsive rendering

- Test confirmed:
  - Rotating green cube appears on screen
  - Lighting creates proper shadows and reflections
  - Animation runs smoothly

## Step 4: Implement Game Loop - COMPLETED

- Created a GameEngine class in core/engine.js:
  - Proper initialization of Three.js components
  - Time-based animation using THREE.Clock
  - Delta time calculation for consistent movement regardless of frame rate
  - Object tracking for updates and rendering
  - Methods for adding and removing objects from the scene

- Refactored main.js to use the new GameEngine:
  - Removed direct Three.js code
  - Added FPS counter for performance monitoring
  - Cleaner separation of initialization and game loop

- Test confirmed:
  - Object moves continuously within the loop
  - FPS counter shows stable frame rate
  - Animation speed is consistent regardless of device performance

## Step 5: Load or Create Player Aircraft Model - COMPLETED

- Created an Aircraft class in entities/aircraft.js:
  - Implemented a voxel-style Spitfire model based on the reference image
  - Added detailed camouflage pattern with green, brown, and RAF roundels
  - Created a more complex model with fuselage, wings, tail, cockpit, and propeller
  - Added landing gear and proper coloring
  - Set up an improved chase camera with better positioning
  - Added propeller animation with two-blade propeller

- Enhanced GameEngine with improved environment:
  - Created a voxel-style terrain with height variation
  - Added blocky clouds that gently bob up and down
  - Added distant mountains for depth
  - Implemented shadows for better visual quality
  - Positioned the aircraft at proper flying altitude

- Test confirmed:
  - Voxel-style Spitfire aircraft model displays correctly
  - Camera provides a good view from behind and slightly to the side of the aircraft
  - Environment has a Minecraft-like appearance with terrain, clouds, and sky
  - Propeller animates correctly and lighting shows the details of the aircraft

## Step 6: Add Keyboard Controls for Plane Movement - COMPLETED

- Created an InputHandler class in utils/input.js:
  - Tracks keyboard input state for arrow keys
  - Provides methods to query key states
  - Prevents default browser behavior for arrow keys

- Enhanced Aircraft class with flight controls:
  - Implemented arrow key controls (Up/Down for pitch, Left/Right for turning)
  - Added physics-based movement with constant forward velocity
  - Implemented banking into turns for more realistic flight
  - Added control parameter tuning (turn rate, pitch rate, max angles)
  - Applied input smoothing for fluid control response

- Updated GameEngine to integrate the input handler:
  - Initialized input handler in the engine
  - Passed the handler to the aircraft for controls
  - Maintained separation of concerns between input and physics

- Test confirmed:
  - Aircraft responds to arrow key inputs
  - Up/Down keys control pitch (ascend/descend)
  - Left/Right keys control turning with proper banking
  - Aircraft movement is smooth with appropriate physics
  - Controls feel responsive but not twitchy 

## Step 7: Add Basic Physics Movement - COMPLETED

- Enhanced the flight physics system with:
  - Implemented forward motion with constant velocity (~5 units/sec)
  - Added banking on turns (up to 30° roll when turning left/right)
  - Increased maximum pitch angles to 45° up/down with realistic momentum
  - Added physics-based inertia and drag for realistic control feel
  - Implemented angular momentum for more natural aircraft movement
  - Limited extreme maneuvers to prevent unrealistic flight patterns
  - Maintained constant forward velocity with subtle air resistance

- Improved aircraft control handling:
  - Added mass and force calculations for more physical response
  - Enhanced control behavior with smooth transitions between states
  - Implemented better vertical movement with appropriate drag and stopping
  - Applied limits to control effectiveness during extreme maneuvers
  - Fine-tuned smoothing factors for responsive but not twitchy controls
  - Fixed orientation issues for proper visual feedback during ascent/descent

- Test confirmed:
  - Aircraft maintains appropriate forward velocity
  - Aircraft banks properly into turns
  - Controls feel responsive but with appropriate weight and momentum
  - Extreme maneuvers are limited for more realistic flight behavior
  - Aircraft exhibits proper inertia, continuing to turn/pitch briefly after key release
  - Aircraft pitches nose up when ascending and nose down when descending
