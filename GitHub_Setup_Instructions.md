# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository for the Air Race Challenge project:

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "air-race-challenge" as the Repository name
4. Add a description: "A 3D air racing game built with Three.js and Vite"
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility based on your preference
6. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/air-race-challenge.git

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## 3. Verify the repository setup

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/air-race-challenge`
2. You should see all your project files on GitHub
3. Confirm that the directory structure and files are displayed correctly

## 4. Set up branch protection (optional but recommended)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" > "Branches"
3. Click "Add rule" under "Branch protection rules"
4. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
5. Check "Require pull request reviews before merging"
6. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

This completes Step 2 of the implementation plan: "Set Up Git and GitHub Repository".
